abstract="Rule-based approaches allow users to customize XR environments. However, the current menu-based interfaces still create barriers for end-user developers. Chatbots based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to reduce the threshold needed for rule creation, but how users articulate their intentions through conversation remains under-explored. This work investigates how users express event-condition-action automation rules in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) environments. Through two user studies, we show that the dialogues share consistent strategies across the interaction setting (keywords, difficulties in expressing conditions, task success), even if we registered different adaptations for each setting (verbal structure, event vs action first rules). Our findings are relevant for the design and implementation of chatbot-based support for expressing automations in an XR setting.",

abstract="Recent advancements in eXtended Reality (XR) technologies have found application across diverse domains. However, creating complex interactions within XR environments remains challenging for non-technical users. In this work, we present EUD4XR, a project aiming to: i) empower end-user developers (EUDevs) to customize XR environments by supporting virtual objects and physical devices; ii) involve an intelligent conversational agent which assists the user in defining behaviours. The agent can handle multimodal input, to drive the EUDev during the rule authoring process, using contextual knowledge of the virtual environment and its elements. By integrating conversational assistance, EUD4XR seeks to lower further the usage barriers for end-users to personalize XR experiences according to their needs.",
